An analysis of several studies  published in the August 2005 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine  concludes that GERD is much more prevalent in people who are  obese.1 The most common GERD symptom is heartburn, but people  with GERD may also experience regurgitation (flow of the stomach’s  acidic contents into the mouth), frequent coughing, and trouble  swallowing.  There are other causative factors of GERD that may be separate  from or intertwined with obesity. The sphincter that separates the  stomach’s internal contents from the esophagus often does not  function properly and acidic gastric contents seep upward.  Sometimes the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus are also  sluggish and compromise the clearance of acidic contents. In  addition to having an unbalanced, high-fat diet, some people with  GERD are sensitive to particular foods—chocolate, garlic, spicy  foods, fried foods, and tomato-based foods—which worsen  symptoms. Drinks containing alcohol or caffeine may also worsen  GERD symptoms. GERD is diagnosed most often by a history of the  frequency of recurring symptoms. A more proper diagnosis can be  made when a doctor inserts a small device into the lower esophagus  that measures the acidity of the contents during one’s daily  activities. About 50 percent of people with GERD have inflamed  tissues in the esophagus.  The first approach to GERD treatment is dietary and lifestyle  modifications. Suggestions are to reduce weight if you are  overweight or obese, avoid foods that worsen GERD symptoms,  1. Hampel H, Abraham NS, El-Serag HB. (2005).

       "  'text': 'above a dam. When water falls through a dam the potential energy  is changed to moving energy (kinetic), that in turn is captured by  turbines. Similarly, when an electrolyte at higher concentration in  the extracellular fluid is transported into a cell, the potential energy  is harnessed and used to perform work.  Cells are constantly transporting nutrients in and wastes out.  How is the concentration of solutes maintained if they are in a  state of flux? This is where electrolytes come into play. The cell  (or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in  its membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish  a chemical gradient. The transport protein, called the glucose  symporter, uses the sodium gradient to power glucose movement  into the cell. Sodium and glucose both move into the cell. Water  passively follows the sodium. To restore balance, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and  water follows. Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves  the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for  two potassium ions into a cell. To maintain charge neutrality on the  outside of cells every sodium cation is followed by a chloride anion.  Every cycle of the pump costs one molecule of ATP (adenosine  triphosphate). The constant work of the sodium-potassium pump  maintains the solute  equilibrium  and consequently, water  distribution between intracellular and extracellular fluids.  The unequal movement of the positively charged sodium and  potassium ions makes intracellular fluid more negatively charged  than the extracellular fluid. This charge gradient is another source  of energy that a cell uses to perform work. You will soon learn  that this charge gradient and the sodium-potassium pump are also  essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction. The many  functions of the sodium-potassium pump in the body account for  approximately a quarter of total resting energy expenditure.

       "  'text': 'inhibited. Thus, glucose additionally has a “fat-sparing” effect. This  is because an increase in blood glucose stimulates release of the  hormone insulin, which tells cells to use glucose (instead of lipids) to  make energy. Adequate glucose levels in the blood also prevent the  development of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic condition resulting  from an elevation of ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are  an alternative energy source that cells can use when glucose supply  is insufficient, such as during fasting. Ketone bodies are acidic and  high elevations in the blood can cause it to become too acidic. This  is rare in healthy adults, but can occur in alcoholics, people who  are malnourished, and in individuals who have Type 1 diabetes. The  minimum amount of carbohydrate in the diet required to inhibit  ketosis in adults is 50 grams per day.  Carbohydrates  are  critical  to  support  life’s  most  basic  function—the production of energy. Without energy none of the  other life processes are performed. Although our bodies can  synthesize glucose it comes at the cost of protein destruction. As  with all nutrients though, carbohydrates are to be consumed in  moderation as having too much or too little in the diet may lead to  health problems.

Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation. Other methods of measuring BMD include quantitative  computed tomography (QCT) and radiographic absorptiometry.  People at risk for developing bone disease are advised to have a  DEXA scan. We will discuss the many risk factors linked to an  increased incidence of osteoporosis and the steps a person can take  to prevent the disease from developing.

Working in Nutrition Registered dietitians (RDs)/registered dietitians nutritionist (RDNs) and nutritionists plan food and nutrition programs, promote healthy eating habits, and recommend dietary modifications based on the needs of individuals or groups. For example, an RD/RDN might teach a patient with hypertension how to follow the DASH diet and reduce their sodium intake. Nutrition-related careers can be extremely varied. Some individuals work in the government, while others are solely in the private sectors (i.e., private practice, worksite wellness, hospitals, outpatient clinics, etc). Some jobs in nutrition focus on working with elite athletes, while others provide guidance to patients with long-term, life-threatening diseases. But no matter the circumstance or the clientele, working in the field of diet and nutrition focuses on helping people improve their dietary habits by translating nutritional science and evidence-based recommendations into food choices. In the public sector, careers in nutrition span from government work to community outreach. RDs who work for the government may become involved with federal food programs, federal agencies, communication campaigns, or creating and analyzing public policy. On the local level, clinical careers include working in hospitals and 1.',\n",
